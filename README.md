# Response to Task 1

The 'FizzBuzz with a Pink Flamingo' program is a simple Python program that prints the output string
to the terminal when executed.

The program can be executed by running `python fizz_buzz_with_a_pink_flamingo` from the project root or `python .` from inside the `fizz_buzz_with_a_pink_flamingo` directory.

The program defaults to a range of 0 to 100 but takes optional arguments to modify this range. If one argument is given, it is the start of the range when less than 100 and the end when greater. When two arguments are given, the smaller number is the start of the range and the larger number is the end.
