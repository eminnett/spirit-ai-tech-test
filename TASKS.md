# Task 1: FizzBuzz with a Pink Flamingo

Write a program that prints the numbers from 0 to 100. But for multiples of three print
“Fizz” instead of the number and for multiples of five prints “Buzz”. For numbers which are
multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. Then extend the program to say
“Flamingo” when a number is a member of the Fibonacci sequence, and “Pink Flamingo”
when it is a multiple of 3 and 5 and a member of the Fibonacci sequence. Hint: A number is
Fibonacci if and only if one or both of `(5*n2 + 4)` or `(5*n2 – 4)` is a perfect square (i.e. A
number made by squaring a whole number).

# Task 2: Roman Numeral Calculator

Start by writing a Roman Numeral converter and from that Roman Numerals. Then write a
Roman Numeral Calculator that takes a string i.e. “XXIV + XI” and returns the result which
would be “XXXV”. Ideally it should perform all BODMAS calculation so:

- Brackets: ()
- Order (power): ^
- Division: /
- Multiplication: *
- Addition: +
- Subtraction: -

# Task 3: Web API

Wrap one or both of the previous tasks in to a web api

# (Stretch) Task 4: Ops vs Frontend

Dockerise the application or build a nice frontend
